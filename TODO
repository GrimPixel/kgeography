******************

 - Add <localname> tag to the map parser/files so the user can see the local name of a division
	Example: In Spanish the user will see for Belgium -> Belgica (due to i18n) and Belgique (due to localname)

 - Add more maps ;-)

 - Have non political maps, support for geographical (rivers, mountains, etc) is almost there if the map is carefully 
   crafted. Example: Have the map all of the same color, then for each river, mountain, etc create a box big enough 
   of the wanted color and then associate the color of the box with the name of the river, etc.
