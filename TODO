 - Add <localname> tag to the map parser/files so the user can see the local name of a division
	Example: In Spanish the user will see for Belgium -> Belgica (due to i18n) and Belgique (due to localname)
 - Add <capital> tag to map parser/files so the program can do these questions:
	In the map: Point to the division whose capital is X.
	In a dialog: Which of these divisions has X as capital? (and give n options)
	In a dialog: Which of these capitals is the capital of division X? (and give n options)
 - Add  <flag> tag that points to a filename of a image containing the flag of the given division, that
  gives to option of ask the same as above or even combine them (whose of these flags is the division with 
  capital X, ...). Can obtain flags with free compatible licenses from

 - Add more maps ;-)

 - Have non political maps, support for geographical (rivers, mountains, etc) is almost there if the map is carefully 
   crafted. Example: Have the map all of the same color, then for each river, mountain, etc create a box big enough 
   of the wanted color and then associate the color of the box with the name of the river, etc.

 - Think of a good way of the question mode for maps, i.e: Next division to click, correct/uncorrect, correct and uncorrect count, etc.
