 - popupManager::show(QString) does not check that the full text can be seen (i.e. x < 0)
   make it wrap the text when it does happen or completely remove it and use KMessageBox::information
   for the only case in which popupManager::show(QString) is used.

 - Add the click on map division given its flag

******************
* Parser related *
******************

 - Add <localname> tag to the map parser/files so the user can see the local name of a division
	Example: In Spanish the user will see for Belgium -> Belgica (due to i18n) and Belgique (due to localname)
 - Add <capital> tag to map parser/files so the program can do these questions:
	In the map: Point to the division whose capital is X.
	In a dialog: Which of these divisions has X as capital? (and give n options)
	In a dialog: Which of these capitals is the capital of division X? (and give n options)

 - Add more maps ;-)

 - Have non political maps, support for geographical (rivers, mountains, etc) is almost there if the map is carefully 
   crafted. Example: Have the map all of the same color, then for each river, mountain, etc create a box big enough 
   of the wanted color and then associate the color of the box with the name of the river, etc.
