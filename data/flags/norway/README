These ‘flags’ (really coat of arms) for the Norwegian
counties were downloaded from Wikipedia
https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fylkesv%C3%A5pen_i_Norge
on 2018-08-27. They were then converted to PNG
files with a common height (200 pixels).

Note that the images at Wikipedia have been improved
over time, so the KGeography images should probably
also be updated in the future.
