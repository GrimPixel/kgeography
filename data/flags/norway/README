The ‘flags’ (really coat of arms) for the pre-2020
Norwegian counties were downloaded from Wikipedia
https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fylkesv%C3%A5pen_i_Norge
on 2018-08-27. They were then converted to PNG
files with a common height (200 pixels).

For the new counties (official from January 2020),
the coat of arms of Agder, Innlandet, Vestfold og Telemark,
Vestland and Viken have been taken from the official
graphic profiles of these counties. For Troms og Finnmark,
a (temporary) coat of arms have been created by merging the
(Wikipedia) images of the coat of arms for the two (pre-2020)
counties Troms and Finnmark.

Note that the images at Wikipedia have been improved
over time, so the KGeography images should probably
also be updated in the future. And the coat of arms
should be taken from official sources (instead of
from Wikipedia) if possible.
